            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 white onion, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 Granny Smith apple, cored and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium (~3 to 4 lb) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh sage</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne</li>
            <li>pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            <li>fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sauté the onion and garlic.</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 to 2 more minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Add the vegetable broth, carrots, apple, butternut squash, sage, cayenne, cinnamon and nutmeg and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer. Then cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20-30 minutes until the vegetables are all tender and mash easily with a fork. Remove and discard the sage. Stir in the coconut milk.</li>
            <li><strong>Purée:</strong> Use an immersion blender to purée the soup until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Season and serve:</strong> Taste and season the soup generously with salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm, topped with your desired garnishes, and enjoy!</li>
